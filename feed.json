Perhaps that&rsquo;ll happen naturally, and we <em>are</em> only a couple of issues in. I also need to codify the separation between the newsletter and this blog. I treat the latter as a kind of notebook on the web, so it would make sense if it also fed into the newsletter, but I want to avoid too much overlap and repetition.</p>\n<p>I’ve also been dusting off <strong>Sipped Ink</strong> — both the website @ <a href=\"https://sipped.ink\">sipped.ink</a>, and the social accounts — in preparation for launching the 8th annual running of the summer read-along (from 5 Jun, <a href=\"https://buttondown.email/sippedink\">join us</a>).

I use this postcard as a daily reminder of impermanence. Looking at it, I imagine that the first image of the triptych represents my waking moments, with the day ahead. The day itself will be the second image: suspended in air, but in motion. The third image is inevitable: it&rsquo;s the night that will arrive to close the day out. I find it useful to be reminded that each day passes like this, and that we experience time in one direction only. Once night arrives, you can no more return to the day than the urn can spring into the air, un-shattered.</p>\n<p>And it&rsquo;s not just days, of course — this is also the manner in which our lives pass. I&rsquo;m publishing this today as it happens to be the fourth anniversary of my mother&rsquo;s death. Perhaps unsurprisingly, that event itself remains the most powerful example in my life that everything is impermanent. This idea is also at the center of the Buddha&rsquo;s teaching, which is how I know he doesn&rsquo;t mind propping up the postcard. I understand that the very idea of <em>momento mori</em> can provoke a reflexive flinch – the mind does not want to ponder its own extinguishing — but I find value in having this metaphor at hand as a reminder. Whatever the day holds, it is unique and it is transient, and it is worth being present for. (I feel the same way if I wake facing the other direction.)</p>\n",

I use this postcard as a daily reminder of impermanence. Looking at it, I imagine that the first image of the triptych represents my waking moments, with the day ahead. The day itself will be the second image: suspended in air, but in motion. The third image is inevitable: it's the night that will arrive to close the day out. I find it useful to be reminded that each day passes like this, and that we experience time in one direction only. Once night arrives, you can no more return to the day than the urn can spring into the air, un-shattered. \n\nAnd it's not just days, of course — this is also the manner in which our lives pass. I'm publishing this today as it happens to be the fourth anniversary of my mother's death. Perhaps unsurprisingly, that event itself remains the most powerful example in my life that everything is impermanent. This idea is also at the center of the Buddha's teaching, which is how I know he doesn't mind propping up the postcard. I understand that the very idea of *momento mori* can provoke a reflexive flinch – the mind does not want to ponder its own extinguishing — but I find value in having this metaphor at hand as a reminder. Whatever the day holds, it is unique and it is transient, and it is worth being present for. (I feel the same way if I wake facing the other direction.)\n",
