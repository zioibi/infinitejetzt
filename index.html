		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>On the very first (proper) episode of Flux Observer, Adam goes back to a movie that was important to him in his childhood: <em>Who Framed Roger Rabbit</em> (1988).</p>
<p>Will he wish he still had his <a href="https://d.pr/i/hHELLg">stuffed Roger and cardboard Benny</a>? Or will the film need to be removed from his <a href="https://infinite.jetzt/20films">all-time Top 20 list</a>?</p>

(My suspicion is that, somewhere in the jumbled filing cabinet of my mind, a page has fallen loose from the folder for Mike Mills’s film <em>Beginners</em> (2010); that would at least explain ⅓ of this nonsense.) ✨</p>

			<h1><a href="https://infinite.jetzt/2022/06/04/how-to-steal.html">How to Steal a Million dir. William Wyler (1966) ★★★★</a></h1>

			 <p>I am too infrequently asked to name my favourite Audrey Hepburn movie, but if I were, most days I would probably say <em>Roman Holiday</em> (1953). And yet I had not seen William Wyler&rsquo;s other light-hearted caper team-up with Hepburn until now.</p>
<p>I could probably watch Audrey drive around Paris in her ridiculous little toy car, wearing Givenchy outfits, for hours beyond the film’s actual running time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Where precisely were you in the early part of the sixteenth century?”<br>
“I don&rsquo;t know, but that&rsquo;s not how I was dressed.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am also yet to see <em>The Children’s Hour</em> (1961), but — as a Lillian Hellman adaptation — that looks to be a different prospect.</p>

			 <p>Complaints — almost exclusively from white men — about ‘wokeness’ or ‘forced diversity’ in mainstream culture have become exhaustingly predictable. And yet, this is the current carousel of featured movies in the iTunes Store, here in May 2022:</p>
<p><img src="https://infinite.jetzt/uploads/2022/58b47cc8a5.png" alt=""></p>
<p>There are more lead roles here for Tom Holland (2), than there are for people who aren’t white men (0). There is such a <em>long</em> way to go. (NB. at the the same time, the cinemas are full of Tom Cruise, Benedict Cumberbatch, &amp; Chris Pratt.)</p>
<p>By contrast — and because Star Wars Celebration was this week — consider the leads on the current live-action Star Wars projects: Ewan McGregor yes, but also Pedro Pascal, Temuera Morrison, Rosario Dawson, &amp; Diego Luna. This is also work being made with truly diverse supporting casts, and created by an equally diverse team of writers, directors etc. I’ve been really happy to see Disney push the franchise in this area since taking ownership of it almost a decade ago.</p>

			 <p>This week a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473">leaked draft opinion</a> from the US Supreme Court made more likely the prospect of widespread banning of abortions across the country. The news shaped a lot of what I&rsquo;ve been reading and watching lately, and in <a href="https://world.hey.com/adamwood/tendrils-003-isn-t-that-just-chess-29f719d7">this weekend&rsquo;s issue of Tendrils</a> I&rsquo;m going to be sharing notes on some fiction and documentary films I watched. I also wanted to make space to share some links to, and excerpts from, the best pieces of journalism I read on the topic:</p>
<ul>
<li>’<a href="https://www.thecut.com/2022/05/roe-v-wade-limits-of-privilege.html#_ga=2.6245626.837078935.1653042934-866592180.1653042934">The Limits of Power in a Post-Roe World</a>’ by Rebecca Traister in the May 9-22, 2022 issue of <em>New York</em> magazine</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>the reasoning behind abortion bans is a lie. Bans do not stop abortions from happening. Rather, they are meant to punish people for asserting control over their bodies, lives, and families, and the people who get punished more cruelly and regularly in this country have always been people who are not white and not wealthy</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>’<a href="https://apple.news/AZ7yQVFCBTOOLzzEifTDcUA">The anti-abortion movement is about to win. Even it isn’t ready for what comes next</a>’ by Anna North in issue #37 of <em>The Highlight</em></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is this same groups of people who are surveilled, suspected, targeted by law enforcement in all realms of their life, who are the ones who are going to be disproportionately criminalized for self-managing abortion,” Adams said. That includes “Black, Indigenous and other people of color, immigrants, trans and gender non-conforming folks, and certainly people living in poverty, as well as people living in rural areas and young people.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>’<a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2022/5/5/23057317/abortion-supreme-court-roe-v-wade">Abortion has been treated as a fringe issue by Democrats for decades. This is the result</a>’ by Anna North for Vox</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The marginalization of abortion in Democratic politics is at least as old as Roe v. Wade. The 1973 decision, which established a constitutional right to an abortion, may have given liberals a false sense of security, Goodwin said. “There was a confidence that the United States was a country that would not roll back, and that would not reach back to its worst tendencies.” It wasn’t just Roe. Americans had also seen the recent gains of the civil rights movement, including the Voting Rights Act and integration of schools, after brutal and sometimes bloody fights. There was “this sense that we can breathe now in the 1970s,” Goodwin said, “that now we can say we’ve learned from these horrors of the past and that we will not take lightly what respecting equality truly means under this flag.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>’<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-the-us-could-learn-from-abortion-without-borders">What the U.S. Could Learn from Abortion Without Borders</a>’ (by Anna Louise Sussman for The New Yorker) centres around comparison with a European assistance network that works to help people seeking abortions in countries such as Poland (where abortion was made illegal in 1993)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>What seems unusual about Abortion Without Borders is that it combines highly visible advocacy, logistical support for abortions, and funding from major N.G.O.s and governments</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>’<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23057032/supreme-court-abortion-rights-roe-v-wade-state-aid">The end of Roe will mean more children living in poverty</a>’ by Dylan Scott for Vox:</li>

<p>The children born in these circumstances will start life a few steps behind, all because their political leaders strove to ban abortion without offering support to the children who would be born if their aims were achieved.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The landmark Turnaway Study on the impacts of being unable to access abortion care found that being forced to keep an unwanted pregnancy significantly increases the risk of being entrapped in an abusive relationship. Another study found nearly a tenth of people who seek abortion care are trying to end their pregnancies because they have abusive partners. Fifteen percent of women experiencing intimate partner violence reported that their partners also subjected them to reproductive coercion.</p>

<p>Finally, I’d also recommend episode 48 of the <em>Strict Scrutiny</em> podcast — ‘<a href="https://crooked.com/podcast/whats-next-in-a-post-roe-world/">What’s Next in a Post-Roe World</a>’ — a conversation between Supreme Court watchers, legal scholars, and a professor of Obstetrics, Gynecology &amp; Reproductive Sciences.</p>

			 <p>Over the past few days I’ve been working on tidying things up online a little. I’ve been (at least partially) happy with how the first couple of issues of the newsletter — now named <strong>Tendrils</strong> and live @ <a href="https://tendrils.email">tendrils.email</a> — have come together. I&rsquo;d like to vary the format a little: <em>sometimes</em> ‘here&rsquo;s what I read; here&rsquo;s what I watched', and sometimes something else. Perhaps that&rsquo;ll happen naturally, and we <em>are</em> only a couple of issues in. I also need to codify the separation between the newsletter and this blog. I treat the latter as a kind of notebook on the web, so it would make sense if it also fed into the newsletter, but I want to avoid too much overlap and repetition.</p>
<p>I’ve also been dusting off <strong>Sipped Ink</strong> — both the website @ <a href="https://sipped.ink">sipped.ink</a>, and the social accounts — in preparation for launching the 8th annual running of the summer read-along (from 5 Jun, <a href="https://buttondown.email/sippedink">join us</a>). I announced the novel selection via Tendrils over the weekend, and the wider announcement is planned for sometime within the next couple of days.</p>

			 <p>In the <a href="https://culture.ghost.io/art-versus-commerce-in-the-nft-era/">latest issue</a> of his excellent newsletter, <em>Culture: An Owner’s Manual</em>, W David Marx lays out the evolution of thinking around the place of art within culture vis-à-vis money. Whilst his argument is focussed on the visual arts, reading it made some related ideas click into place for me.</p>
<p>As it has evolved over the last decade or so, there has been a particular aspect of culture that I’ve felt especially repelled by: a steadily increasing comfort with, and latterly widespread embrace of, the commercialisation and commodification of art. As a cynical member of Gen X, who thought the height of cool was Nirvana <a href="https://youtu.be/DzRAZ1uS-Ao">refusing to mime</a> on <em>Top of the Pops</em>, and Kurt Cobain wearing a ‘<a href="https://pin.it/5SpE1Ds">Corporate Magazines Still Suck</a>’ t-shirt on the cover of <em>Rolling Stone</em>, perhaps I&rsquo;m particularly primed to find this sad and irksome. Nevertheless, few things bug me more than the willingness (even eagerness) to subvert and distort the authentic self, and genuine art, in service of popularity and monetary gain.</p>
<p>I’m a middle-aged man — I <em>should</em> be irritated by a mainstream culture predominantly aimed at younger generations. But isn&rsquo;t it supposed to be because young people are being thoughtless, are acting reckless, and have a shocking lack of respect for prior generations' culture? Instead the whole landscape seems to be awash with branded influencer opportunities on Instagram, and dreams of a career generating subscription revenue for Amazon, whilst shilling energy drinks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not fair to lay all of this at Gen Z&rsquo;s feet: NFTs (the latest, most crass, and most thoroughly meritless commodification in the name of art) are largely not their fault. I think partly I&rsquo;m just cranky that <em>everything</em> went this way. To an increasing extent, as we progressed into the 21st century, culture moved online, and online became culture. The creeping commercialisation and centralisation of that space necessarily resulted in similar mutations in art &amp; culture. W David Marx&rsquo;s argument feels especially sound to me in that respect: we moved from an avant-garde that believed ‘true art can&rsquo;t be commercialized’, via a series of hops, to a modern era in which ‘monetization <em>is</em> the culture’. Heck, you can even buy <a href="https://falseto.com/2019/05/23/kurt-cobains-corporate-magazines-still-suck-shirt-becomes-550-designer-tee/">a copy of that t-shirt</a> for $550.<br>

			 <p>There’s a sense in which the Cubs not being remotely competitive this season leads to a real reduction in stress when watching these games. It feels a little like a return to the loveable losers kind of baseball that we’re used to watching, with the year-after-year post-season contention being the anomaly. In that respect, weeks of losing baseball kind of blurs together, and I’m just able to enjoy the occasional high point here and there. I feel less down about series losses, and still excited by individual excellent performances, or even just great plays.</p>
<p>Case in point: <a href="https://www.mlb.com/gameday/cubs-vs-padres/2022/05/09/662259#game_state=final,lock_state=final,game_tab=box,game=662259">yesterday’s game against the Padres</a> was a <em>lot</em> of fun. A 6-0 win, with Hendricks looking pretty much as good as it gets: three hits through 8.2. Heyward had a nice game, as did Gomes, and so too did Nico — I love to see some aggressive base running, and he generated a run in the 8th.</p>
<p>It just goes to show: there’s still plenty of fun to be had when the team’s not exactly where you’d like them to be. Heck, the White Sox have a record .143 better at the moment, but their fans were probably <a href="https://www.mlb.com/gameday/guardians-vs-white-sox/2022/05/09/661525#game_state=final,lock_state=final,game_tab=box,game=661525">pretty unhappy last night</a>.</p>

			 <p>Happy Star Wars Day to you. As has become tradition, I&rsquo;ve updated my checklist of canon media, and you can grab a PDF <a href="https://infinite.jetzt/uploads/2022/82d3eaba55.pdf">here</a> or the plain text version <a href="https://pastebin.com/c36Pn1Z9">here</a>. This is a checklist of (as near as I can make it) every item of canon Star Wars media intended for young adults and above. (There are several books, comics, and cartoon shorts intended for a younger audience not included here, though they are canon; please don&rsquo;t consider this list <em>absolutely</em> exhaustive, but I think it&rsquo;s a good basis for an adult or young adult looking to get a sense of the canon.) You can find other versions of things like this elsewhere on the web, but this is a list I&rsquo;ve put together for myself, and which I use when reading, watching, and playing my way through all things Star Wars.</p>
<p>My thanks as always in this endeavour go to the folks who maintain Wookieepedia&rsquo;s indispensable <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline_of_canon_media">&lsquo;Timeline of Canon Media&rsquo;</a>: a sortable list of <em>all</em> canon material, and also to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/StarWarsExplained/featured">Star Wars Explained</a> YouTube channel.</p>

			 <p>As you may know if you’ve poked around this site, or have been visiting for a while, each summer I run a group read-along of a lengthy novel, conducted via email newsletter, under the title <em>Sipped Ink</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I like the newsletter format. I subscribe to quite a few, and receiving one often feels personal and considered in a way that reading someone’s posts to a social network doesn’t. Of course, I know that the email I’m reading has many more recipients beyond me, but still: my email account is a private space, to which I have elected to grant the sender admittance; it feels very different to reading material posted in the public square of eg. Twitter, or even Medium.</p>
<p>Personal blogs have something of this feeling too, of course. Whether I’m pointing my browser towards someone’s site, or having their posts arrive in my RSS reader, there’s a sense of calm about choosing whose words you want to read, and finding that material in the shape the author intended, unfettered by format constraints, and without adverts or cookie pop-ups. It feels a little like stepping into a version of the internet before the forces of centralisation had really got to grips with shaping it in their own image.</p>
<p>For a while, I sent out an occasional email newsletter of my own. It was called <em>FYI</em>, and it ran to a grand total of 24 issues over the course of about a year, 2018-19. Almost incomprehensibly, that was four years ago, and here I am letting you know that I’m going to try my hand at the medium again. I’m shying away from committing to a format or frequency, but I’m excited to play around and see what feels interesting. You can read the announcement issue, and sign up if you so choose, <a href="https://world.hey.com/adamwood/hi-hello-how-are-you-b7d45688">right over here</a>.</p>

			 <p>Today — 30 Apr — is <a href="https://www.daysoftheyear.com/days/independent-bookstore-day/">Independent Bookstore Day</a>, and I wanted to shout out a neat little enterprise that was recently launched. I’ve been watching CJ Alberts’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CJReads">book content on YouTube</a> for a couple of years, and it was the nice kind of surprise when she announced last year that she was going to start her own little second-hand book business: <a href="https://www.sunnysbooktruck.com">Sunny&rsquo;s Book Truck</a>. She and her husband bought a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CVGad3_vI9o/">cute little Japanese truck</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CaTRuxuJk9P/">painted it yellow</a>, and have been busy buying up interesting, good quality books to make up the initial stock.</p>
<p>All of that would be admirable enough, but CJ &amp; Kiki have also spun up a neat line of <a href="https://www.sunnysbooktruck.com/shop">Sunny’s merch</a>, and — starting in June — a <a href="https://www.sunnysbooktruck.com/book-club">Book Club</a>.</p>
<p>I dig the can-do spirit of the whole thing, and they’re executing it really well. So, this Independent Bookstore Day, I recommend <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sunnysbooktruck/">following Sunny’s on Instagram</a>, watching a couple of CJ’s videos, and maybe buying something from your local indie.</p>

			 <p>I really like <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/lost-thread/">these thoughts</a> from Robin Sloan, related to this week’s Twitter news:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are so many ways people might relate to one another online, so many ways exchange and conviviality might be organized. Look at these screens, this wash of pixels, the liquid potential! What a colossal bummer that Twitter eked out a local maximum; that its network effect still (!) consumes the fuel for other possibilities, other explorations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/about/">Sloan</a> has been off the platform for a while, and has constructed a cottage industry of blogposts, newsletters, strange online projects, and… an <a href="https://fat.gold">olive oil business.</a> I particularly recommend his novel <em>Sourdough</em> (2017), which is weird, heart-warming, and very funny.<br>

			<h1><a href="https://infinite.jetzt/2022/04/21/010000.html">Idea for a Video Game Puzzle</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://infinite.jetzt/2022/04/21/010000.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-04-21 01:00:00 &#43;0100">Apr 21, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I’m not a game designer, but a couple of nights ago a puzzle came to me in a dream, more or less complete. It seems like a waste not to do <em>something</em> with it, so I thought I&rsquo;d at least write it up. If you are a game designer, or you have another use for any part of this, you&rsquo;re more than welcome to it.</p>
<p>The basis of the puzzle is a rectangular room, at the center of which is a long, rectangular table. There’s one chair on each side of the table, perhaps more ornate ones on the two ends, and simpler ones on the longer sides. Elsewhere in the game — perhaps throughout the wider house — there should be contextual clues that will enable the player to discern which of four family members sits in each of the four spots. As an example (and because this is how it was in my dream), let’s call these people Adam, Eve, Cain, &amp; Abel.</p>
<p>Around the room, on and against each of its four walls, there should be a series of items with unique, distinctive features: eg. a painting of a sunset; a sculpture of a whale; a taxidermy owl; a vase of flowers. Taken together, here’s a sketch of the basic layout:</p>
<p><img src="https://infinite.jetzt/uploads/2022/5015009291.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The puzzle itself operates by giving the player a prompt, comprising a subject and a vantage point: eg. ‘Sunset, aspect of Cain’. The player must determine in which cardinal direction the corresponding object in the room sits <strong>in relation to</strong> the named person; they must then press the corresponding direction on their controller’s directional pad. The correct response to the prompt above, therefore, would be ↑.</p>
<p>For the sake of completeness, let me note that in my dream this actually had to be done for two object / vantage pairs, simultaneously. The prompt read eg. ‘Sunset, aspect of Abel; Whale, aspect of Eve’, and two inputs had to be made simultaneously: one on the directional pad, and one on the face buttons. The correct response to the above prompt would be ↓ &amp; B on an Xbox controller, or ↓ &amp; ◯ on a PlayStation controller. A series of five correct dual-inputs had to be made, against a short timer, to complete the puzzle. This was one of those frustration dreams where you repeatedly attempt and fail at a task, so if you do implement any version of this, I’d consider staying away from this more complicated iteration!</p>

			 <p>Over the weekend I played through <a href="https://annapurnainteractive.com/games/a-memoir-blue"><em>A Memoir Blue</em></a>, a short &lsquo;interactive poem&rsquo; from Cloisters Interactive. Its combination of relatively light interactivity, with a focus on telling a personal story, reminded me of titles like ustwo&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.ustwogames.co.uk/games/assemble/"><em>Assemble With Care</em></a>, and the superb <a href="https://annapurnainteractive.com/games/florence"><em>Florence</em></a> by Mountains (with which <em>A Memoir Blue</em> shares a publisher in Annapurna Interactive).</p>
<p>I found a lot to like in the magical realist tone, and the really effective manner in which it&rsquo;s conjured through the mixing of two distinct animation styles. Both the 3D models and the hand-drawn animated characters are imbued with an impressive sense of personality. But, just as impressive, the world of the story is brought to life with charming detail and a really effective sense of material weight, which is far easier experienced than it is described.</p>

			 <p>I learned this afternoon of the passing of Taylor Hawkins, a drummer I&rsquo;ve been listening to and admiring for more than two decades. You would think that being the drummer in Dave Grohl&rsquo;s band would be a thankless task, and yet Hawkins always seemed to relish it; he seemed aware of his good fortune, and humble about his own incredible talents.</p>
<p>I liked these lines from the <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/taylor-hawkins-obituary-foo-fighters-more-than-the-drummer">piece <em>Kerrang</em> published</a> in his memory today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The loss of Taylor Hawkins is incredibly sad. 50 is no age. He had a wife and children. And what is there to say? Perhaps, really, that a life cut so tragically short was one that brought such joy to literally millions of music fans.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Love to his friends, family, &amp; bandmates. Taylor Hawkins forever.</p>

			 <p>The first thing I see when I open my eyes in the morning depends upon which way I&rsquo;ve rolled during the night. If I wake up laying on my right side, I open my eyes to see my partner; if I&rsquo;ve rolled left, the first thing I see is this:</p>
<p><img src="https://infinite.jetzt/uploads/2022/be30829c15.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This little tableau features a small metal Buddha, serving as both a hook for a rosewood mala, and a prop to keep a postcard upright. It&rsquo;s the postcard I want to talk about: I picked it up at Ai Weiwei&rsquo;s show at the Royal Academy in 2015; it shows his triptych &lsquo;Dropping a Han Dynasty Urn&rsquo; (1995). Here&rsquo;s a better look at the artwork:</p>
<p><img src="https://infinite.jetzt/uploads/2022/52fe37da58.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Much of the commentary around this piece focusses on the (seven figure) value of the urn in question, but for my purposes it could just as easily have been an entirely unremarkable, mass-produced ceramic vase. I use this postcard as a daily reminder of impermanence. Looking at it, I imagine that the first image of the triptych represents my waking moments, with the day ahead. The day itself will be the second image: suspended in air, but in motion. The third image is inevitable: it&rsquo;s the night that will arrive to close the day out. I find it useful to be reminded that each day passes like this, and that we experience time in one direction only. Once night arrives, you can no more return to the day than the urn can spring into the air, un-shattered.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just days, of course — this is also the manner in which our lives pass. I&rsquo;m publishing this today as it happens to be the fourth anniversary of my mother&rsquo;s death. Perhaps unsurprisingly, that event itself remains the most powerful example in my life that everything is impermanent. This idea is also at the center of the Buddha&rsquo;s teaching, which is how I know he doesn&rsquo;t mind propping up the postcard. I understand that the very idea of <em>momento mori</em> can provoke a reflexive flinch – the mind does not want to ponder its own extinguishing — but I find value in having this metaphor at hand as a reminder. Whatever the day holds, it is unique and it is transient, and it is worth being present for. (I feel the same way if I wake facing the other direction.)</p>

			 <p>A couple of days ago I finally sat down to watch Julia Ducournau&rsquo;s <em>Titane</em> (2021), the Palme d&rsquo;Or-winning follow up to her 2016 feature film debut: the brilliantly executed coming-of-age horror <em>Raw</em>. I&rsquo;ve vacillated over whether to write anything about <em>Titane</em>, because so much of its power comes from working against what an audience expects, and pushing the viewer&rsquo;s boundaries. In the end, however, I couldn&rsquo;t resist putting something down, so <a href="/titane">here&rsquo;s a piece providing some context</a> for how I felt about the film.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://infinite.jetzt/2022/03/15/010000.html">Dave Eggers — The Museum of Rain (2021)</a></h1>

			 <p>Over coffee this morning I read <a href="https://store.mcsweeneys.net/products/the-museum-of-rain?taxon_id=1"><em>The Museum of Rain</em></a> (2021) by Dave Eggers. It&rsquo;s a sweet, touching short story about place and creativity. (I note that there&rsquo;s also an audiobook version, narrated by Jeff Daniels, which I&rsquo;m sure would be a great experience.) I&rsquo;ve been an admirer of Eggers for many years, as a writer who unfailingly centres his work (fiction &amp; non-fiction alike) on his characters' humanity. This small dose has renewed my intention to pick up his most recent novel: <em>The Every, or, At Last a Sense of Order, or, The Final Days of Free Will, or Limitless Choice Is Killing the World</em> (2021).</p>
<hr>
<p>As an aside, the Penguin hardback edition of Eggers&rsquo;s first novel — <em>You Shall Know Our Velocity</em> (2002) — still has one of my favourite designs: the cover pulls you into the flow of the story, and the text itself begins immediately on the endpaper inside.</p>
<p><img src="https://infinite.jetzt/uploads/2022/a7125d6d05.png" alt=""><br>

<p>As a second aside, the novel&rsquo;s titular Museum of Rain couldn&rsquo;t help but remind me of Roni Horn&rsquo;s art installation / institution: <a href="https://hyperallergic.com/226116/a-library-of-glacial-water-in-iceland/">Vatnasafn (Library of Water)</a>. During the years we lived in Iceland we made the trip to Stykkishólmur only once, and unfortunately during the wrong season – the library was closed for winter. You can just about see the building on the far right here, atop a hillock:</p>

			 <p>Here&rsquo;s a fun thing that happened today. I needed more coffee beans, and luckily I live two streets away from an <a href="https://themissingbean.co.uk">excellent roastery</a>. As I was also in possession of that most magical of objects, the fully stamped loyalty card, I decided I&rsquo;d combine the trip for beans with a coffee to stay. On my way out the door — not wanting to lug all 1.2kg of Hanya Yanagihara&rsquo;s <em>To Paradise</em> to the café — I took a book from the shelf that I&rsquo;d yet to start: Lauren Groff&rsquo;s <em>Matrix</em> (an eminently more portable 450g).</p>
<p>When I arrived, the place was pretty full; I picked up my bag of beans, ordered a coffee, and sat in one of the only open spots. A few minutes into both my coffee and Groff’s novel, the woman sitting opposite me looked up from her laptop, and said “I reviewed that book”. This led to a conversation about Lauren Groff, Hanya Yanagihara, and long novels in general. It felt like a very Oxford coincidence to be starting a new book, having unknowingly sat directly across from the person who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/sep/10/matrix-by-lauren-groff-review-a-brilliant-nuns-tale">reviewed it for <em>The Guardian</em></a>.</p>

			 <p>It’s official: there will be a major league baseball season in 2022! Now that the league and the players association have reached accord on a new collective bargaining agreement, Spring Training is due to begin this Sunday, with the (full, 162 game) regular season commencing on Thursday, 7 April. That’s less than four weeks away, so it’s time to start recklessly speculating on what the next few days might hold in store.</p>
<p>This was always going to be an interesting off-season for the Cubs, given that they traded away the majority of their star players at the 2021 trade deadline. Position players, pitching rotation, bullpen… the only questions are over where the Cubs need the <em>most</em> help.</p>
<p>Prior to the lock-out stalling all negotiations, the club had already made a few moves:</p>
<p>outfielders Clint Frazier and Harold Ramírez were added from the Yankees and Guardians (<a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/cleveland-indians-change-name-to-guardians">née Indians</a>) respectively;</p>
<p>veteran Yan Gomes was brought in as a reliable backup to the league’s most overworked catcher: Willson Contreras;</p>
<p>the pitching rotation got a boost with the additions of Wade Miley from the Reds, and — in the team’s most significant move to date — a 3-year / $71M contract for Marcus Stroman;</p>
<p>So, what might happen now? At the time of writing, there are a <em>lot</em> of big-name free agents still on the market, many of whom would make sensible additions for the Cubs. Questions remain around how much the club’s ownership are willing to spend, and exactly how they’re approaching this phase of the team’s rebuild / rework: are they planning to make big moves this year, or is the focus on building a bridge to the years ahead, which will (hopefully) see an exciting clutch of farm system talent arrive in MLB? Either way, the NL Central remains eminently winnable for a solid Cubs team, and the expanded 12-team playoffs format makes the post-season both more attainable and less predictable.</p>
<p>With all that said, here are some names I’d like to see announced for the Cubs in the coming days:</p>
<p>Carlos Correa: the biggest star of the free agency field is already the target of a <a href="https://twitter.com/STR0/status/1502017971027283976?s=20&amp;t=n1DGzyxr8M2JPyt2ZKOxjQ">lobbying campaign</a> by brand new Cub, Marcus Stroman. As well as going some way towards cushioning the blow that was the loss of Javier Báez, the addition of a platinum glove shortstop would allow for more options for Nico Hoerner &amp; Nick Madrigal.</p>
<p>Anthony Rizzo: I just want the captain back. I want to erase the memory of him ever having worn a Yankees jersey. One day I want to include in my visit to Chicago, a trip to the Anthony Rizzo statue at Wrigley Field. (Also, if the team is to transition to a new core, Rizzo could play a vital role in the clubhouse.)</p>
<p>Kris Bryant: this feels unlikely to happen, but KB remains one of the best, most versatile players in the game.</p>
<p>Kyle Schwarber: particularly with the advent of the designated hitter in the NL, the return of yet another former Cub would be a great fit.</p>
<p>Nick Castellanos: whilst we’re at it, why not bring back a reliable third baseman and extra base machine?</p>
<p>OK, admittedly this turned into mostly a list of old faces I’d like to see back in a Cubs shirt. Any one of these signings would add a great storyline for the upcoming season, but honestly, I’m just happy baseball is back!</p>

			 <p>I’d like to take a moment to share my appreciation for Arthur Brooks’s cover story for <em>The Atlantic</em>: <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/03/why-we-are-never-satisfied-happiness/621304/">‘The Satisfaction Trap’</a>. The piece is an excellent, immensely readable topography of thinking on the topic of satisfaction. Brooks consults everything from pop music to Buddhist thought, in order to marvel at the power of the illusion we commonly operate under: that lasting satisfaction can be attained from more.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you base your sense of self-worth on success—money, power, prestige—you will run from victory to victory, initially to keep feeling good, and then to avoid feeling awful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brooks also introduces an explanation for the pervasiveness of this illusion that I don’t remember encountering before quite in these terms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We live in a time when we are regularly counseled to get back to nature, to our long-ago past—in our diets, our sense of communal obligation, and more. But if our goal is happiness that endures, following our natural urges does not help us, in the main. That is Mother Nature’s cruel hoax. Happiness doesn’t help propagate the species, so nature doesn’t select for it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, Brooks returns to the lessons of Buddhism and minimalism, whilst acknowledging that, to deep-seated parts of ourselves, they initially feel counterintuitive:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our urge for more is quite powerful, but stronger still is our resistance to less.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I strongly recommend reading <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/03/why-we-are-never-satisfied-happiness/621304/">the whole thing</a>.<br>

<p>Here are some other pieces I enjoyed this weekend:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://auderdy.com/2021/08/19/philip-glass-on-artificial-intelligence-and-art/">‘Philip Glass on Artificial Intelligence’</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s an emotional structure as well as the compositional structure, and that’s the part we have to get to. What we like about the art is the way it unfolds, the way we can evolve with it.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://thenewinquiry.com/cringe/">‘Other Trans People Make Me Dysphoric’</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Like all forms of lashing out, this “right-wing rage” is equal parts viciousness and lack. How can you be loved and cared for when I—who want love and care so badly—can’t seem to get it at all?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/69d94162-8580-4001-96ea-42675739d483">‘The International Mystery of The Hum’</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>It is partly the way one frames a noise that makes it distressing. We ascribe moral qualities to sound. If a factory is running equipment, that sound is inherently more irritating than, say, morning bird song, because it implies a lack of consideration, a hierarchy of priorities that a sparrow cannot have.</p>

			 <p>Last night the annual Academy of British Cover Design awards took place at The Underbelly in Hoxton Sq. I always enjoy browsing <a href="https://abcoverd.co.uk/archive?year=2022">the archive</a>; invariably it&rsquo;s overloaded with variety and creative ingenuity.</p>

			 <p><strong>Hi, hello, how are you?</strong> It’s been a while.</p>
<p>Through a process of considerable trial-and-error, I’ve found that it works best for me to be actively present online for only <em>part</em> of the year. More by circumstance than design, I’ve come to model these cycles on the MLB season: hibernating offline over winter, and reappearing alongside Spring Training.</p>
<p>This year is a little different: at the time of writing it’s still not clear when / if the 2022 baseball season will get underway. The first games of spring should have been played by now, but ongoing negotiations between the league and the players’ association (over a new collective bargaining agreement) have resulted in a series of postponements.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the advent of a new month is as good a date as any for this year’s reemergence. So, the site is live once again, and this blog / journal / notebook portion has been scrubbed clean. Over the coming months it’ll be home to ideas, questions, links to things I like, and all manner of other miscellanea: it’s intended as an all-purpose notebook on the web.</p>
<p>Elsewhere across the site, you can find an updated index of more substantial pieces <a href="/archive">here</a>; the archive of annual favourite album lists <a href="/thelists">over here</a>; and trackers keeping tabs on what I’ve been <a href="/2022books">reading</a>, <a href="/2022filmtv">watching</a>, <a href="/2022games">playing</a>, and <a href="/2022music">listening to</a>.</p>
<p>I hope you’re well despite the continual, and increasing, strangeness of the world. Thanks for stopping by.</p>
